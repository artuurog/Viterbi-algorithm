The file viterby_function.py contains a Python implementation of the Viterbi algorithm. 
The file sim_func.py contains an example of application, where a one-hot encoded series of observations is generated and subsequently usec as input for the Viterbi function.
  The objective of this code is to show a potential application of the implemented function, where the objective is to retrieve the most probable sequence of states that generate the particular observed sequence.
